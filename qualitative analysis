# Introduction

The FAIR-X project aim to promote systematic reporting of sex and gender in research and foster diversity in biomedical practises. The European Commission, NIH and other institutions aims to make sex and gender analysis mandatory in the research and its policy would apply to all disciplines. 
This survey want to analyze the awareness about the account for sex (biological characteristics commonly used to classify people as male, female or intersex) and gender (socially constructed roles, norms and identities, not necessarily binary or aligned with a personâ€™s sex) in their research. As well, capturing diversity in e.g., sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity. 
Science benefits from diversity, improving the participation of under-represented groups is not just fairer, it could produce better research. We can make a change, we can have a better science! 

1. Does your dataset include variables that foster an intersectional analysis and interpretation of results?
  Sex Yes / No
  Gender Yes / No
  Age Yes / No
  Ethnicity Yes / No
  NA
  
2. Are you familiarised with guidelines or recommendations of best practices in biomedical research? (DOME: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01205-4; SAGER: )
  I don't know them
  I know them but I don't apply them
  I know them but I don't need them
  I know them but I don't agree with them
  I know them and I use them
  I know others: ...
  NA
  
3. Do you think capturing diversity (e.g., sex, gender, age, ethnicity) for biomedical research is:
  Not relevant
  Relevant not mandatory
  Relevant and mandatory
  Critical
  I don't know
  
4. Would you be interested in receiving training on social and ethical implications of biomedical research?
  Yes
  No
  I don't know

5. Have you experienced difficulties with datasets having many missing values of diversity data due to data donnors withdrawing (parts of) informed consent?
  Never
  Sometimes
  Often
  Always
  NA

6. Do you think educating data donnors would help raising awareness on the importance of diversity data for fair research outcomes?
 1 Not at all important
 2
 3
 4
 5 Extremely important

 
7. The European Commision has published a Gender equality plan to opt for research fundings. Also the Gendered Innovation published a report recommending how to introduce the sex and gender dimension in biomedical research.
-- add one line about editorial power -- How important is to include diversity information in publication and funding processes?
  Not important
  Important only for publications and Intellectual Property 
  Important only for fundings
  Important for both
  Neither
  Others: ...

8. Which mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that public and private biomedical research capture diversity dimension? (multiple answers)
  Self-assessment
  International Standards
  Codes of conduct
  Legal regulation
  Editorial policy requirements
  Requirements by funding bodies
  Regulated bodies (e.g., FDA, EMA (spain AEMPS))
  All
  None
  Others: ...
